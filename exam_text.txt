Consider the following Counting game:

A player draws 6 different numbers. The goal is to combine these numbers using the elementary arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to obtain a number as close as possible to a given goal. 
Combining numbers means the following. First, the player chooses an initial number from the starting six numbers in their hand. Then, they choose a second number from their hand (different from the initial one), together with an operation, and compute the result of the operation. Now they choose a third number from their hand (different from the first and the second number), an operation, and compute the results. And so on.

For example, if the user draws the numbers 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 e 50, and the goal number is 462, they can combine their numbers in the following way:

8 + 1 = 9
9 * 50 = 450
450 + 10 = 460
460 - 3 = 457
457 + 5 = 462

Here, the player precisely reached the goal number. However, there are cases in which this is not possible. In such cases, the player has to aim to find the closest possible number to the goal.
If it is possible to precisely reach the goal number, the players should try to minimize the numbers used. E.g., in the previous game, a better solution would have been:

50 - 3 = 47
47 * 10 = 470
470 - 8 = 462 

which only uses 4 numbers instead of 6.

Each number can only be used one time. 

Your task is to implement a function CountingStrategy() that takes as input a list of 6 user numbers and 1 goal number, and returns the winning strategy. 
The winning strategy should be printed in the following form:
  Initial number: <n1>
  Step 1: operation <operation> with number <n2> -> result <r2>
  Step 2: operation <operation> with number <n3> -> result <r3>
  ...
  Final number: <final_result>
  Distance from goal: <distance>


E.g.:
CountingStrategy([1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 50], 462) should output:
  Initial number: 50
  Step 1: operation - with number 3 -> result 47
  Step 2: operation * with number 10 -> result 470
  Step 3: operation - with number 8 -> result 462
  Final number: 462
  Distance from goal: 0
